# Installation 

One can install the Python package dependencies via the attached environment.yml file.  To do the simulations, one will need to install the [sijia branch](https://github.com/aolabNeuro/brain-python-interface/tree/sijia) from the aolab bmi3d repository. This branch has the necessary simulation components to run the simulations. 


# encoder setup 

in the simulation setup, one can specify the relative poisson noise generated by the encoder as a noise profile.
