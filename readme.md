# Installation 

One can install the Python package dependencies via the attached environment.yml file.  To do the simulations, one will need to install the [sijia branch](https://github.com/aolabNeuro/brain-python-interface/tree/sijia) from the aolab bmi3d repository. This branch has the necessary simulation components to run the simulations. 


# encoder setup 

in the simulation setup, one can specify the relative poisson noise generated by the encoder as a noise profile.  


# encoder change setup
## swap the top and bottom halves of the neurons

  run_convex_selection(
                encoder_change_mode = "swap_top_and_bottom", # we don't want to change the encoder
                change_sim_c_at_cycle = change_sim_c_at_cycle,
                RANDOM_INITIAL_FEATURES_COUNT = NUM_INITIAL_FEATURES,
                number_of_features = 32,
